Description: Process and analyze Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Frequency and 
    contingency tables for many binary outcomes and a binary exposure variable can be 
    generated more efficiently. Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS) performed 
    using EHR data can be analyzed using three commonly used statistical analysis 
    methods: Firth's penalized-likelihood logistic regression; logistic regression 
    with likelihood ratio test; conventional logistic regression with Wald test.
