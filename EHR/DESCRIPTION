Description: Process and analyze Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The `EHR`
    package provides modules to perform diverse medication-related studies using
    data from EHR databases. Especially, the package includes modules to perform
    pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses using EHRs, as outlined in
    Choi et al. (2020). Additional modules will be added in future. In addition,
    this package provides various functions useful to perform Phenome Wide
    Association Study (PheWAS) to explore associations between drug exposure and
    phenotypes obtained from EHR data (Choi et al., 2018).
